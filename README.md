# JavaScript Superintelligence

Who says we can't do serious A.I. development using JavaScript?

Let's get serious and demonstrate the power of neural networks using the world's most robust development platform, a simple internet browser.

While we're at it, let's take it to another level and begin to ponder superintelligent will.  Let's not institutionalize human foresight and their ability to learn upon artificially intelligent agents.

Finally, let's combine neural networks and superintelligent will for some serious fun.

## Install & Run
    npm install -g parcel
    npm install -g yarn
    yarn install
    parcel index.html

Fire up a browser and open up `http://localhost:1234`.

Takes about 2 hours to "fully" train, but there definitely opportunity to optimize by altering reward, hyperparameters, and/or network.
